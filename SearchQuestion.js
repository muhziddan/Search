If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS/DFS

If the tree is very wide:
BFS

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

Finding the shortest path:
BFS
