/*

If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS, because it start searching from the closest node to the root

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
BFS, because DFS:
1. take long time
2. because it uses recursion

If the tree is very wide:
DFS, because BFS need too much memory

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

Finding the shortest path:
BFS
